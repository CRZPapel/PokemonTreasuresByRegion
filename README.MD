# Pok√©mon Valuable Items Analysis üéÆ

### üìÑ Project Description

This project aims to analyze and visualize valuable items obtainable in the Pok√©mon games by completing different regions with an alternate account. The analysis covers items such as TMs, HMs, evolution stones, held items for evolution, valuable items for sale, vitamins, herbal medicines, type-enhancing items, and other valuable items. It provides insights into the distribution of these items across various regions and helps in strategic planning for Pok√©mon gameplay.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Libraries**: Pandas for data handling, Seaborn and Matplotlib for data visualization.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used for code development, data exploration, and visualization.
- **BeautifulSoup**: Used for web scraping to retrieve item data from Bulbapedia.

### üì¶ Data Sources

The primary data source for this project is Bulbapedia, a community-driven Pok√©mon encyclopedia. Data is retrieved by scraping information from Bulbapedia web pages.

### üßπ Data Cleaning, Analysis, and Visualization Techniques

1. **Data Retrieval**: The data is obtained by scraping item information from Bulbapedia pages using BeautifulSoup.

2. **Data Cleaning**: Data cleaning involves handling non-breaking space characters, removing irrelevant mechanics, and categorizing items into specific groups.

3. **Data Analysis**: The project analyzes valuable items based on their categories and region-specific distribution.

4. **Data Visualization**: Visualization techniques include barplots to compare common valuable items in different regions, heatmaps for item category distribution by region, and barplots to visualize the count of Technical Machines (TMs) obtainable per region.

The project uses Python and relevant libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization to provide insights into Pok√©mon gameplay and item availability, mainly focused on what's available in the PokeMMO game.
